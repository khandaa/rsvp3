### Notes

- Unit tests are placed alongside their implementation files with a `_test` suffix
- Backend tests can be run using `pytest`
- Frontend tests can be run using `npm test`
- The system will support multiple weddings/events per administrator
- RSVP forms will have minimal customization options
- Phone and email are mandatory fields for guests
- Data retention policy is 30 days after the event
- WhatsApp integration will be limited to 1000 guests maximum
- Dietary preferences and meal selection will be supported in the RSVP process
